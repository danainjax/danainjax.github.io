What is coding? That’s not for me. I *am not* a tech person. Math is *not *my thing. (That’s what I thought.) For twenty years I thought that. Maybe more. 

I’ve always loved working with computers, but also always assumed I did not have the aptitude to work with them past my current role, because math and science didn’t interest me as much as literature, movies, thinking, contemplation, philosophy, and yes- travel. I’ve been a travel agent for over twenty years. That’s a long time to do something. When I think about the favorite parts of my job there are two:

1. Getting to travel places I have never been to before. Discovery. Exploration. Adventure.

2. Working primarily on a computer in multiple global distribution systems. Figuring out how and why the entries work and return what they do.

I’m on an adventure, now. To join my life-long love of discovery with that love of computing in coding.

Sometimes what we think we know is only the best we know at a particular time. If I had known there was art in code; art in computer languages, that there was more to it than what it seemed… I would have been here long ago. I’ve always felt somewhat bewildered by the nagging feeling that I wasn’t passionate about anything. Passion was for other people. Well, I’ve found it. I am bananas for software engineering, for code, and for figuring out every last little detail of how and why things work.

Here’s to what’s next! **My ticket to tech.**
